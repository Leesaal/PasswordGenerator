# PasswordGenerator

## Description

This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript and will create a password depending on different criteria selected by the user.

There is a minimum password length of 8 characters and maximum of 127 characters that the site will not allow you choose below or above.

When the button "Generate Password", the new password will show in the box in black where it will originally say "Your Secure Password".

This program also hides the criteria until generate password is clicked and then the criteria will show.
